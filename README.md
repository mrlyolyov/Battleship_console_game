The Problem
Implement a very simple game of battle ships.

You should create a simple console application to allow two human players to play with each other.

The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
•	1 x Battleship (5 squares)
•	2 x Destroyers (4 squares)
Ships can touch but they must not overlap.

The console application should accept input from the user in the format “A5” to signify a square to target, and feedback to the user whether the shot was success, and additionally report on the sinking of any vessels.
. = no shot
- = miss
X = hit
